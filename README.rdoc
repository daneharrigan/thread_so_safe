= thread_so_safe

thread_so_safe is a very simple gem to help keep multi-threaded environments synced.

== Examples

  # Starting thread-safety is easy!
  ThreadSoSafe.safeguard('My.Application')
  ThreadSoSafe.safeguard('My.Second.Application')

  # Time to check if our data is till up to date
  unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?('My.Application')
    puts "Updating data..."
    ThreadSoSafe.update!('My.Application')
  end

  unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?('My.Second.Application')
    # update second set of data
    ThreadSoSafe.update!('My.Second.Application')
  end

  # If you're working with only one application you can use the slightly shorter-hand
  unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?
    # bring your code up to date
    ThreadSoSafe.update!
  end
