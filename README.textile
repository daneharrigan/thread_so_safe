h1. thread_so_safe

thread_so_safe is a very simple gem to help keep multi-threaded environments synced.

h2. Examples

<code><pre>
# Starting thread-safety is easy!
ThreadSoSafe.safeguard('My.Application')
ThreadSoSafe.safeguard('My.Second.Application')

# Time to check if our data is till up to date
unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?('My.Application')
  puts "Updating data..."
  ThreadSoSafe.update!('My.Application')
end

unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?('My.Second.Application')
  # update second set of data
  ThreadSoSafe.update!('My.Second.Application')
end

# If you're working with only one application you can use the slightly shorter-hand
unless ThreadSoSafe.safe?
  # bring your code up to date
  ThreadSoSafe.update!
end
</pre></code>
